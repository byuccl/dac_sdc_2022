### Textbook

The class has one required textbook:

[Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, 7th Edition by Kurose and Ross](https://amzn.com/0133594149){:target="_blank"}


The book comes with some online tools to help you understand the material:

- [Powerpoint Slides](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/ppt.htm){:target="_blank"}
- [Interactive Problems](http://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive/){:target="_blank"}


### Learning Resources

Here are some other resources that might help you:

- [Introduction to Computer Networks](https://csedu4all.org/course_networks/){:target="_blank"}

- The YouTube channel Computerphile has some good videos on networking:
    - [TCP Meltdown](https://youtu.be/AAssk2N_oPk){:target="_blank"}
    - [VPN & Remote Working](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mtSNVdC7tM){:target="_blank"}


### Debugging Resources

There are a few tools that will be invaluable when debugging your labs.

- [netcat (nc)](http://netcat.sourceforge.net){:target="_blank"}
: This is a good tool for basic TCP and UDP socket debugging. It can connect to a socket or act as a socket server. It will show you all the raw data that is sent and received.

- [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org){:target="_blank"}
: This is an indispensable tool for any networking professional. This will show you all packets being sent between two devices.

- [httpie](https://httpie.org){:target="_blank"}
: In my opinion, this is the best commandline HTTP tool.

- [curl](https://curl.haxx.se){:target="_blank"}
: An alternative and precursor to `httpie`. Comes standard on most Linux distros.
